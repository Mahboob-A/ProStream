<summary><h3 align="center">Challenges and Learnings</h3></summary>

#### Challenges 

* ProStream is a team project. The first challenge we faced as a team was to communicate with the team members for a smooth workflow. We were a diverse team. As I, <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A">Mahboob Alam</a>, am from India, and the other two members  <a href="https://github.com/ab-atiq">Abul Bashar Atiq</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AlSaimun">Abdullah Al Saimun</a> of ProStream  was from Bangladesh. 

* While building an application like ProStream, we struggled in `database design`. We have researched and built `PoC` of database design before integrating it into the ProStream platform. 

 
#### Learning 

##### My (<a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A">Mahboob Alam</a>) Learning 

* I have learnt to communicate with diverse team a remote software developer. 

* I had the opportunity to manage and maintain the the project from `dev-to-production`, I have gathered valuable understanding how to ship `bug-free` software. 

* I had the opportunity to deploy the project in `AWS EC2 Ubuntu 22.04` server. While doing so, I have gained practical understanding of provisioning and deploying a project to a `Cloud VPC`. 

* I was responsible to `API design` and  `database design`, I have learnt best practices of database design,  `UML Diagram`,  `ERD Diagram`. 


##### Learning as a Team 

* The SDLC of the project taught us how we as a team can research, plan,  and choose the right and best suited option to integrate to a project without re-inventing the wheel for faster software delivery. 

* We as a team learnt how a team-play works and how as a team we can collaborate to bring better result. 
 
* As a team, we have learnt from each others experiences and valuable inputs during the meetings. 
  
* We used Jira to manage our tasks. We were not limited to met only during stand-up meetings, we were prompt to meet if there was an emergency during the development or production of ProStream.
